/**
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
 * so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection
 * link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how
 * your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary
 * tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure
